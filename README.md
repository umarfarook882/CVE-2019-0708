Please, check the above two link to understand the how rdp connectioin sequence work and vabout vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows RDP kernel driver - termdd.sys (MS_T120)

## My approach:

I am n00bs in kernel exploitation and debugging :)

**Day 1:**

Initially gone through the Unauthenticated CVE-2019-0708 "BlueKeep" Scanner PoC script - [cve_2019_0708_bluekeep.rb](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/CVE-2019-0708/blob/master/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep.rb) to understand how they implemented the poc script. So i enabled the verbose mode in metasploit datastore and started analysis output. But it was too hard to understand. I thought let's implemented the same poc in python.

**Day 2:**

I have written the Unauthenticated CVE-2019-0708 "BlueKeep" Scanner in python, which help me lot in understanding the RDP Connection Sequence and packets. Then started playing with rdp packets to figure out the crash for 2 days, I Failed :(

**Note:** `cve_2019_0708_bluekeep.py` is Unauthenticated CVE-2019-0708 "BlueKeep" Scanner PoC, not actual exploit.

**Day 4:**

I realized where i made mistake :) Instead of using existing poc script,  I started writing POC from scratch with TLS to make task easy in sending rdp packets.

Note: Please read the MSDN documentation properly, everything is very clear

**Day 5:**

Finally i got the crash, Check the Demo Video :)
